## Three.js tutorial

### Official guide

**Docs**:https://threejs.org/docs
**Manual**:https://threejs.org/manual

### Getting started

I installed "three" by "`npm install --save three`", but you can just use "`npm i`" in the workspace`s terminal to install all the relevant dependencies.Also, if you want to update or rollback any dependency, you could try to exchange the version wrote in the "package.json" file and uninstall the previously installed version.

### Introduction

- Three.js is a JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics and animations in web browsers. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating and manipulating 3D scenes, objects, and materials, and supports various features such as shapes, lighting, shadows, animation, and interaction.
- Three.js uses WebGL technology, which allows it to run in web browsers that support WebGL without requiring additional plugins or software. It supports various 3D file formats, such as OBJ, STL, and GLTF, and can directly load 3D models from files or the web.
- Three.js also provides various tools and examples to help users quickly get started and learn, such as the Three.js editor, Three.js examples, and Three.js documentation.
- In summary, Three.js is a powerful and easy-to-use 3D graphics library, which can be used to create various web applications, such as games, virtual reality, data visualization, and more.

### Fundamentals in Three.js

- **Renderer**:Accroding to the image above, you could find that `renderer` is at a prior position. In renderer class you could also find this element is essentially a canvas in the web page, and then its role is to render according to the scene and camera. There are two ways you could choose to customize the canvas on the website.First one is creating a canvas element in ".html" file, and use `getElementById()` or any `getElement` function to initialize a corresponding object in ".js" file, and then pass this object as a parameter to the renderer instantiation, just like:`renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas = document.getElementById('threejsCanvas') });` The second way of customizing the canvas is using `renderer.domElement`.If you did not create a canvas in ".html" file, `renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();` would defaultly create a canvas. And you could use `renderer.domElement` to design it.

- **Scene**:Three.js's core is arguably its scene graph. A scene graph in a 3D engine is a hierarchy of nodes in a graph where each node represents a local space.This is a very interesting point you should try. Two most usalbe functions are `scene.add()` and `scene.remove()`.Also, you can add or remove objects like `object.add()` or `object.remove()`, in that case, please pay attention to here is a hierarchy between objects.Reference:https://threejs.org/manual/?q=scene#en/scenegraph

- **Camera**:Decision of the fov(Field of View).The adaptation of its parameters often depends on the aspect ratio of the window and the position of the camera and object.The official version of Three.js offers many different types of cameras for you to use in various scenarios.

- **Mesh**:`Mesh` objects represent drawing a specific Geometry with a specific Material. Both Material objects and Geometry objects can be used by multiple `Mesh` objects. For example to draw two blue cubes in different locations we could need two `Mesh` objects to represent the position and orientation of each cube. We would only need one Geometry to hold the vertex data for a cube and we would only need one Material to specify the color blue. Both `Mesh` objects could reference the same Geometry object and the same Material object.

- **Geomrtry**:`Geometry` objects represent the vertex data of some piece of geometry like a sphere, cube, plane, dog, cat, human, tree, building, etc... Three.js provides many kinds of built in geometry primitives. You can also create custom geometry as well as load geometry from files.

- **Material**:`Material` objects represent the surface properties used to draw geometry including things like the color to use and how shiny it is. A `Material` can also reference one or more Texture objects which can be used, for example, to wrap an image onto the surface of a geometry.

- **Texture**:`Texture` objects generally represent images either loaded from image files, generated from a canvas or rendered from another scene.

- **Light**:`Light` objects represent different kinds of lights.

### Problem solution

1. Some specific classes have been divided into different packages. So you should separately import them like: `import { OBJLoader } from '../node_modules/three/examples/jsm/loaders/OBJLoader.js';`
2. You need to learn and understand some of the mathematics in threejs, especially with respect to vectors.Reference:https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/
3. You need to be aware of memory leaks, such as when you load a model, you need to think about when to dispose of it.
