## Exchange shoe models

### Adjust models in Blender

1. Open Blender and import the reference model by " **File -> Import -> .obj -> 'choose the reference model'** ".
2. Import the model you want to added in the project in the same way in Blender then set the same scale, rotation and position as the reference model.
3. Set the model`s origin as the same as the axis in Blender:first, drop the cursor to the axis origin, then right click on the added model "**Set Origin -> Origin to 3D Cursor**".
4. Delete all elements except for the added model in Blender by "**x**".
5. Export the added model into the project`s file located "./objModel/shoe" by "**File -> Export ->.obj**".
6. Please remember the names of ".obj" file and ".mtl" file, you will use and adjust them in the project`s JS file.

**Reference model**:"./objModels/shoe.obj"

### Apply models to the code

1. Instantiate an object of the modelLoader class (I`ve instantiated six objects in the use of "modelContainer")
2. You just need to replace the objects` initial parameters to your two files relevant locations,just like "**models[x] = new modelLoader('<your left shoe model .mtl>', '<your left shoe model .obj>', '<your right shoe model .mtl>', '<your right shoe model .obj>');**"

**Reference class**:"class modelLoader"
**Initializing object example**:"models[0] = new modelLoader('../objModel/shoe1/shoe1L.mtl', '../objModel/shoe1/shoe1L.obj', '../objModel/shoe1/shoe1R.mtl', '../objModel/shoe1/shoe1R.obj');"
**P.S.**:If you have texture image, please put it into the same location as ".mtl" file and ".obj" file`s.Then the MTLLoader will automatically recognize if the name of the texture matches the name in ".mtl" file.Also, please focused on the names in ".obj" file and ".mtl" file.
